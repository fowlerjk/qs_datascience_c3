-- This is a basic SQL comment line, it helps with explaining what happens in the code
-- You can make a single line comment by typing "--" first, then the text
-- OR you can do a whole block by starting with a slash and asterisk and then ending with an asterisk then slash as seen below
/* line one
line two
line three
line four */

-- Anyway, here's a basic SQL statement

SELECT
field1
,field2
FROM
table1
WHERE
field1 LIKE '%string%'
